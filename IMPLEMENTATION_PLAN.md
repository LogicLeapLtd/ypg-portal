# YPG Platform Implementation Plan

## Current State vs Target State

The current application is structured as a professional networking platform with a general focus. We need to transform it into a student-focused educational platform specifically for hospitality and culinary students.

## Changes Required

### User Authentication & Roles

- [ ] Modify user data model to distinguish between student and admin roles
- [ ] Update registration flow to include college selection and area of interest (Chef, Hotel, Baker, etc.)
- [ ] Add email verification functionality
- [ ] Implement separate login flows for students and administrators

### Student Features

- [ ] Create portfolio upload functionality (PDF, DOCX, images)
- [ ] Build student profile page showing institution and portfolio items
- [ ] Develop onboarding checklist for new students
- [ ] Implement career exploration section with hospitality-focused roles

### Admin Features

- [ ] Develop admin dashboard with student metrics
- [ ] Create content management interface for careers and assignments
- [ ] Add user management capabilities (add/edit/remove students)
- [ ] Implement data export functionality

### UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] Update color scheme to be warm, inclusive and education-focused
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness across all pages
- [ ] Improve accessibility features for all user types
- [ ] Create clear navigation paths for both student and admin users
